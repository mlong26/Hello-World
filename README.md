# Hello-World

Hey everyone,

My name is Mark, I'm new to programming and looking to learn more.  I've been taught HTML and CSS mostly, but am taking time to learn Python now.  I'm not entirely sure what my end goal is but, right now I'm just looking to learn as much as I can and diversify my languages all while learning cool stuff.  So far, Python is my favourite of the languages to learn, even though it's been tough.  Based out of Victoria, BC, Canada.

Thanks for reading!
